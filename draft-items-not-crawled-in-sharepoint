# Draft items are not crawled in SharePoint

## Symptom

Microsoft SharePoint is not crawling the draft items to return in search results.

## Cause

By default SharePoint only crawls major versions of files and draft items are only viewable by their creators. SharePoint is behaving as expected out of box.

## Resolution

This behavior can be altered in **Document Library Settings** -> **Versioning Settings** -> **Draft Item Security**

Select the option **Any user who can read items**. 

This will allow all users to see draft items including the crawling account.
